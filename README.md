### Key Insights 
* USA is the largest issuer of stocks, followed by Japan and Germany, whilst Switzerland and Canada issue a much smaller amount.
* The number of stocks being traded has increased steadily since 2000, though it currently appears 2023 has fewer compared to 2022 but this is due to 2023 not being complete yet, with data to come regarding October, November and December.
* Since 2000 to present, Apple are by far in the lead with the highest average trading volume which is almost 4 times as large as Amazon which has the second largest average trading volume. Google are at similar levels with Amazon, whilst Adidas, BMW, Ubisoft and Puma have an average trading volume below 100,000.
* In 2023, Tesla are in the lead with the greatest trading volume which exceeds 1.5 billion, followed by Apple, Amazon and Amd.
* E-commerce, Technology, Automotive and Finance industries experience the greatest trading volumes, whereas Music, Gaming and Luxury Goods experience fewer levels of trading.
* This month (Sep 2023), stocks of Ubisoft, Zoom, Porsche and Peloton are found to have reached very low prices, so investors should be attentive due to the greater volatility that comes with lower stock prices despite the potential to offer higher returns.
* The 50 day simple moving average for Google shows a steady increase during this month, indicating an upward trend and thus a rise in Google's stock prices.
